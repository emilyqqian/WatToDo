## Purpose
- To design and implement a web-based collaborative To-Do task manager application that helps individuals and teams efficiently organize, prioritize, and complete tasks. 
WatToDo enables individuals and teams to organize, share, and track tasks through customizable task boards. The application encourages productivity through gamification, leaderboards, and shared accountability while ensuring security, scalability, and modular design.

## Objectives
- Develop a functional To-Do web app with user authentication and persistent task storage.
- Implement Task Boards that support both personal use and enable teams to collaborate, assign roles, and track progress.
- Integrate a gamification layer with a clean and unique UI, XP points, streaks, and achievements to encourage consistent productivity.
- Create a Leaderboard system that allows users to compete with friends and teamates.
- Design and execute comprehensive testing (unit + integration) to ensure system reliability.

## Scope
- Development of a Crow + MySQL back-end with a clean, responsive front-end (HTML/CSS/JS or Crow templates).
- Core CRUD functionality:
- Users: `registerUser`, `getUser`, `updateUserInfo`, `inviteUser`, `getAllInvitation`.
- Tasks: `addTask`, `updateTask`, `deleteTask`.
- Task Boards: `createTaskBoard`, `updateTaskBoard`, `deleteTaskBoard`, `getTaskBoardByUser`.
- Leaderboard: `getLeaderboard`
- Display Up-coming tasks on front end.  
- User-specific task retrieval based on `userid`. 
- Implementation of shared task boards and user roles (Member, Admin).
- Implementation of assigning tasks to specific users
