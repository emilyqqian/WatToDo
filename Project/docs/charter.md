## Purpose
- To design and implement a web-based collaborative To-Do application that helps individuals and teams efficiently organize, prioritize, and complete tasks. The app will focus on improving productivity and motivation through shared task boards and a gamified progress system. Initially, the system will be hosted locally using Crow, and MySQL, with the potential to expand to a fully web-deployed version.
## Objectives
- Develop a functional To-Do web app with user authentication and persistent task storage.
- Implement shared task boards that enable teams to collaborate, assign roles, and track progress.
- Integrate a gamification layer with a clean and unique UI, XP points, streaks, and achievements to encourage consistent productivity.
- Create a Leaderboard system that allows users to compete with friends and teamates.
- Design and execute comprehensive testing (unit + integration) to ensure system reliability.

## Scope
- Development of a Crow + MySQL back-end with a clean, responsive front-end (HTML/CSS/JS or Crow templates).
- Implementation of core CRUD operations (`add`, `update`, `delete`, `getTaskByUser`, `addUser`, `updateUser`) and display coming up tasks on front end.  
- User-specific task retrieval based on `userid`. 
- Implementation of shared task boards and user roles (Owner, Contributor, Viewer).
- XP and achievement system with streak tracking logic and a Leaderboard for streaks.
- Comprehensive test plan and test cases for all functions.

- Fully functional Crow web application.
- MySQL database schema and ER diagram.
